We possess a 'ch2.dmp' memory file with a size of 537 MB, indicating substantial RAM capacity. Initially, we will confirm the profile of this memory using Volatility 2
```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp imageinfo
```
we get this output here :

![imageinfo](screens/imageinfo.png)
**so we confirmed that the profile is:** "--profile=Win7SP1x86_23418"
Next, we'll use the "hivelist" plugin to find the System host-name from the memory dump. This plugin lists the active registry hives, which are like specific folders in the Windows Registryâ€”a digital filing cabinet that stores essential instructions for the computer's behavior and program settings. Each registry hive represents a dedicated section for specific configurations, such as personal preferences or system-wide settings.
by running this command : 

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 hivelist
```
**Here, we obtain the registry hives:**

So what we will do to get the workstation's hostename from it?
First, we use the "printkey" option to specify the key value of the registry folder like this :
```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -o 0x8b21c008
```
Now we can see all subkeys of the system registry :
