We possess a 'ch2.dmp' memory file with a size of 537 MB, indicating substantial RAM capacity. Initially, we will confirm the profile of this memory using Volatility 2
```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp imageinfo
```
we get this output here :

![imageinfo](screens/imageinfo.png)
**so we confirmed that the profile is:** "--profile=Win7SP1x86_23418"
Next, we'll use the "hivelist" plugin to find the System host-name from the memory dump. This plugin lists the active registry hives, which are like specific folders in the Windows Registryâ€”a digital filing cabinet that stores essential instructions for the computer's behavior and program settings. Each registry hive represents a dedicated section for specific configurations, such as personal preferences or system-wide settings.
by running this command : 

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 hivelist
```
**Here, we obtain the registry hives:**

So what we will do to get the workstation's hostename from it?
First, we use the "printkey" option to specify the key value of the registry folder like this :
```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -o 0x8b21c008
```
Now we can see all subkeys of the system registry :
![subkey1](screens/subkey1.png)

I guess that the first key is the right choose let's run it : 
```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -o 0x8b21c008 -K "ControlSet001"
```
**output**

![subkeys2](screens/subkeys2.png)

 here we continue with the Control subkey using the back slash **"\"**  :

 ```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -o 0x8b21c008 -K "ControlSet001\Control"
```
Now, we have an extensive list of keys, resembling database tables:

![subkeys3](screens/subkeys3.png)

If we carefully read through this key, we'll find our target key, "ComputerName," as we are specifically searching for the workstation hostname. Let's proceed with the final step :

 ```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -o 0x8b21c008 -K "ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName"
```
![subkeys4](screens/subkeys4.png)
we check the "ActiveComputerName" key : 

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f ch2.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -o 0x8b21c008 -K "ControlSet001\ControlComputerName\ActiveComputerName"
```
**And voila, we've successfully obtained the workstation's hostname!**

**which is: WIN-ETSA91RKCFP**
